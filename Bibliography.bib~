The application of these tools presents two basic advantages: (1) their graphic/mathematical interpretation makes them particularly useful to be applied in simulation/analysis (optimization) applications, and (2) they can be considered from a discrete/continuous point of view, as a paradigm for modeling and analyzing discrete systems or as a continuous approximation to the real discrete model. These properties are very interesting in a global simulation analysis of logistic systems because their management is usually limited by their high complexity and large dimension. Petri nets are applied to the modeling and analysis of discrete logistic systems in the classical way, using the relatively recent continuization and fluidification techniques of discrete systems for their continuous approximation. This new methodology provides results with less computational effort.}

We also study the concept of strongly connected, strongly repetitive and conservative GPN’s. The main results obtained are (i) every strongly connected, strongly repetitive and forward- (or backward-) conflict-free GPN must be conservative, and (ii) every strongly connected, conservative and forward- (or backward-) concurrent-free GPN must be strongly repetitive. Since the class of forward-conflict-free GPN’s contains properly the structures of computation graphs of Karp and Miller and marked graphs, some results appearing in these studies can be obtained as corollaries. Specialized versions of our results for the case of Petri nets are also included.}

It appears that Petri nets can also be used in studying the interconnection properties of large-scale distributed processor systems, which have recently received much interest because of the decline in hardware costs brought about by the LSI single-chip microprocessor. It has been shown that a Petri net (with a slight modification) is as powerful as the Turing machine in representing the coordination of asynchronous processes.

	abstract = {Design of robust supervisory controllers for manufacturing systems with unreliable resources has received significant attention recently. Robustness analysis provides an alternative way to analyse a perturbed system to quickly respond to resource failures. Although we have analysed the robustness properties of several subclasses of ordinary Petri nets (PNs), analysis for non-ordinary PNs has not been done. Non-ordinary PNs have weighted arcs and have the advantage to compactly model operations requiring multiple parts or resources. In this article, we consider a class of flexible assembly/disassembly manufacturing systems and propose a non-ordinary flexible assembly/disassembly Petri net (NFADPN) model for this class of systems. As the class of flexible assembly/disassembly manufacturing systems can be regarded as the integration and interactions of a set of assembly/disassembly subprocesses, a bottom-up approach is adopted in this article to construct the NFADPN models. Due to the routing flexibility in NFADPN, there may exist different ways to accomplish the tasks. To characterise different ways to accomplish the tasks, we propose the concept of completely connected subprocesses. As long as there exists a set of completely connected subprocesses for certain type of products, the production of that type of products can still be maintained without requiring the whole NFADPN to be live. To take advantage of the alternative routes without enforcing liveness for the whole system, we generalise the concept of persistent production proposed to NFADPN. We propose a condition for persistent production based on the concept of completely connected subprocesses. We extend robustness analysis to NFADPN by exploiting its structure. We identify several patterns of resource failures and characterise the conditions to maintain operation in the presence of resource failures. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

In the case of bounded Petri nets and unbounded fair Petri nets, algorithms were given to find process expression for them. The process net system of a Petri net Σ is a new net system Σ, where the transition set of Σ́ is the basic process sections of Σ, the place set of Σ́ is the union of input and output place set for all basic process sections of Σ, the flow relation of Σ́ can be defined by the union of input relation and output relation between the transition set and place set of Σ, and the initial marking of Σ́ is same to Σ. It is easy to know that from the construction of process net system of a Petri net, there is a one to one correspondence between the set of subjective process of any Petri net Σ (bounded or unbounded) and the set of firing sequence of its process net system Σ́.

	abstract = {Motivated by security and privacy considerations in applications of discrete event systems, various notions of opacity have been introduced. Specifically, a system is said to be current-state opaque if the entrance of the system state to a set of secret states remains opaque (uncertain) to an intruder - at least until the system leaves the set of secret states. This notion, which has been studied in non-deterministic finite automaton settings where the intruder observes a subset of events, has been shown to be useful in characterizing security requirements in many applications (including encryption using pseudo-random generators and trajectory coverage of a mobile agent in sensor networks). One limitation of these existing approaches is that they fail to provide a quantifiable measure for characterizing the degree of opacity of a given system. In this paper, we partially address this limitation by extending this framework to systems that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata, characterizing in the process the probability of observing a violation of current-state opacity. We introduce the notion of step-based almost current-state opacity which provides a measure of opacity for a given system. We also propose a verification method for this probabilistic notion of opacity and characterize its computational complexity. ©2010 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Petri Net Markup Language (PNML) is an XML-based interchange format for all kinds of Petri nets, which is an ISO/IEC International Standard 15909-2 now. The focus of this standard is on PNML as an interchange format for high-level Petri nets. PNML, however, is more general and allows exchanging all kinds of Petri nets. To this end, PNML introduced the concept of Petri Net Type Definitions. There are many tools supporting one form of PNML or another. In particular, there is the PNML Framework, which helps tool developers implementing an interface to PNML by providing a framework and an API for loading and saving Petri net documents in PNML. This framework is based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework and has the focus on the underlying meta-models of Petri nets. The PNML Framework, however, is not generic in the following sense: Whenever a new Petri net type is created, the code for the complete tool needs to be regenerated. Moreover, the PNML Framework does not come with a graphical editor. The ePNK overcomes these limitations: It provides an extension-point so that new Petri net types can be plugged into the ePNK without touching the code of the ePNK. For defining a new Petri net type, the developer, basically, needs to give a class diagram defining the concepts of the new Petri net type, along with a mapping of these concepts to XML syntax. This type can then be plugged into the ePNK, and its graphical editor will be able to edit nets of this new type with all its features. This paper present the main idea of the ePNK, and how to use and extend it. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

For this reason, the automation of the decision making for achieving the best design and operation of such systems, which may be regarded as discrete event systems (DESs), constitutes an active research field. In this paper, we present a methodology to cope with this process in an efficient way, optimizing not only the behaviour of the DES but also its structure. This kind of problem is usually associated with the so-called combinatorial explosion, since the number of alternative configurations for the DES might be huge. We present an improved algorithm to transform a set of alternative Petri nets, representing alternative structural configurations, into a more compact model called an alternatives aggregation Petri net. In real decision-making problems, where the different alternative structural configurations may share common subnets, this compact model may allow the development of a much more efficient optimization problem than the classic approach of 'divide and conquer'. The achievement of this objective is performed by developing a single and compact model for all of the alternative structural configurations of the DES and the simulation of the most promising of them. In this paper, the mentioned methodology is introduced and its advantages and drawbacks are described in relation with the classic approach. © 2012 The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.},

It may be considered as a self-standing problem, or it can be seen as a pre-requisite for solving a problem of different nature, such as stabilization, state-feedback control, diagnosis, etc. In the case of Continuous Petri Nets (CPNs), this problem has been studied for both untimed and timed models. In this chapter it is considered first the problem of observability of timed CPNs under infinite server semantics (or variable speed). It is assumed that the marking of some places are measured due to some sensors and the problem is to estimate the initial/ actual state/marking. Three different concepts of observability are defined based on the knowledge of the firing rate vector and, algebraic and graph-based criteria are presented. In the last part, untimed CPNs are considered. Measuring/observing the firing amount in which some transitions are fired, it is shown that the set of possible markings in which the system may be is convex. Based on this characterization, some linear programming problems are presented permitting the computation of diagnosis states when some unobservable transitions model possible faults. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.},

This technique results in a model, named continuous or fluid, whose state variables (the marking at the places) take real nonnegative values. Among the implications, the fluidization opens the possibility for transferring concepts and techniques from the continuous-state systems paradigm to the discrete event systems one. In this chapter, the concept of non-forced continuous Petri net is recalled, together with the most usual firing semantics for the timed interpretation of this model. Certain properties on the resulting fluid models are described, remarking limitations and advantages found in the analysis of fluid Petri nets. The focus is on the relationships between the discrete and the continuous Petri nets. It is also discussed the quality of the relaxation, from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. In particular, questions like the preservation of liveness, boundedness or the marking evolution, are addressed. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.},

	abstract = {The analysis of Discrete Event Systems suffer from the well known state explosion problem. A classical technique to overcome this problem is to relax the behaviour by partially removing the integrality constraints, thus dealing with hybrid or continuous systems. In the Petri nets framework, continuous net systems (technically hybrid systems) are the result of removing the integrality constraint in the firing of transitions. This relaxation may highly reduce the complexity of analysis techniques but may not preserve important properties of the original system. This paper deals with the basic operation of fluidization. More precisely, it aims at establishing conditions that a discrete system must satisfy so that a given property is preserved by the continuous system. These conditions will be mainly based on the here introduced marking homothetic behaviours of the system. The focus will be on logical properties as boundedness, deadlock-freeness, liveness and reversibility. Furthermore, testing homothetic monotonicity of some properties in the discrete systems will be considered.},

In this paper, the approximation of the average marking of Markovian Petri nets by the marking of the corresponding timed continuous Petri nets, under infinite-server semantics, is studied. This represents a sort of legitimization for the use of a continuous Petri net as a relaxation of a discrete Petri net. The main contribution is the addition of Gaussian noise in order to improve the approximation when the number of active servers (enabling degree) is large. The improvement is more evident when the system evolves close to the boundary of regions. In such a case, not only the expected value but also the probability distribution function of the marking may be approximated. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As a preliminary overview, this work provides first a broad tutorial on the fluidization of discrete event dynamic models, an efficient technique for dealing with the classical state explosion problem. Even if named as continuous or fluid, the relaxed models obtained are frequently hybrid in a technical sense. Thus, there is plenty of room for using discrete, hybrid and continuous model techniques for logical verification, performance evaluation and control studies. Moreover, the possibilities for transferring concepts and techniques from one modeling paradigm to others are very significant, so there is much space for synergy. As a central modeling paradigm for parallel and synchronized discrete event systems, Petri nets (PNs) are then considered in much more detail. In this sense, this paper is somewhat complementary to David and Alla (2010). Our presentation of fluid views or approximations of PNs has sometimes a flavor of a survey, but also introduces some new ideas or techniques. Among the aspects that distinguish the adopted approach are: the focus on the relationships between discrete and continuous PN models, both for untimed, i.e., fully non-deterministic abstractions, and timed versions; the use of structure theory of (discrete) PNs, algebraic and graph based concepts and results; and the bridge to Automatic Control Theory. After discussing observability and controllability issues, the most technical part in this work, the paper concludes with some remarks and possible directions for future research. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This formalism has been extensively used to represent complex systems and shows its full potential when arise a large number of subnets with the same static structure thanks to the folding process. In this paper a completely new application of the Coloured Petri nets is presented. It implies a conceptual variation in the traditional scope of use of the CPN. The coloured Petri nets will be used to represent sets of alternative Petri nets. In other words, they will represent a set of exclusive models for a single DES by means if a unique CPN. The main advantage in this application of the coloured Petri nets is that they can be used to develop efficient algorithms to solve optimization problems based on Petri net models.},

The expected gains are twofold: improvements in complexity and in decidability. In the case of autonomous nets we prove that liveness or deadlock-freeness remain decidable and can be checked more efficiently than in Petri nets. Then we introduce time in the model which now behaves as a dynamical system driven by differential equations and we study it w.r.t. expressiveness and decidability issues. On the one hand, we prove that this model is equivalent to timed differential Petri nets which are a slight extension of systems driven by linear differential equations (LDE). On the other hand, (contrary to the systems driven by LDEs) we show that continuous timed Petri nets are able to simulate Turing machines and thus that basic properties become undecidable. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) is a graphical language for modelling and validating concurrent and distributed systems, and other systems in which concurrency plays a major role. The development of such systems is particularly challenging because of inherent intricacies like possible nondeterminism and the immense number of possible execution sequences. In this textbook Jensen and Kristensen introduce the constructs of the CPN modelling language and present the related analysis methods in detail. They also provide a comprehensive road map for the practical use of CPN by showcasing selected industrial case studies that illustrate the practical use of CPN modelling and validation for design, specification, simulation, verification and implementation in various application domains. Their presentation primarily aims at readers interested in the practical use of CPN. Thus all concepts and constructs are first informally introduced through examples and then followed by formal definitions (which may be skipped). The book is ideally suitable for a one-semester course at an advanced undergraduate or graduate level, and through its strong application examples can also serve for self-study.

	abstract = {Continuous Petri nets were introduced as an approximation to deal with the state explosion problem which can appear in discrete event models. When time is introduced, the flow through a fluidified transition can be defined in many ways. The most used in literature are constant and variable speed (David and Alla, Discrete, continuous and hybrid Petri nets, Springer-Verlag, 2005), which can be seen as some kind of finite and infinite server interpretations of the transitions behavior, and derived from stochastic (discrete) Petri nets (Silva and Recalde, Annu Rev Control 28(2):253-266, 2004). In this paper we will compare the results obtained with both relaxations for the broad class of mono-T-semiflow reducible nets, and prove that, under some frequently true conditions, infinite server semantics offers a throughput which is closer to the throughput of the discrete system in steady state. In the second part, it will be proved that the throughput of mono-T-semiflow reducible net systems is monotone with respect to the speed of the transitions and the initial marking of the net. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Coloured Petri Nets is a discrete-event modelling language combining Petri nets with the functional programming language Standard ML. Petri nets provide the foundation of the graphical notation and the basic primitives for modelling concurrency, communication, and synchronisation. Standard ML provides the primitives for the definition of data types, describing data manipulation, and for creating compact and parameterisable models. A CPN model of a system is an executable model representing the states of the system and the events (transitions) that can cause the system to change state. The CPN language makes it possible to organise a model as a set of modules, and it includes a time concept for representing the time taken to execute events in the modelled system. CPN Tools is an industrial-strength computer tool for constructing and analysing CPN models. Using CPN Tools, it is possible to investigate the behaviour of the modelled system using simulation, to verify properties by means of state space methods and model checking, and to conduct simulation-based performance analysis. User interaction with CPN Tools is based on direct manipulation of the graphical representation of the CPN model using interaction techniques, such as tool palettes and marking menus.

	abstract = {Petri Nets (PN) can be interpreted as an underlying global structure common to a family of formalisms with different levels of abstraction and interpretations, which constitute a paradigm for the modeling, simulation, analysis, synthesis and implementation of discrete systems. Due to their efficiency to cope with concurrence, parallel evolutions and synchronism, they have been widely used in automated manufacturing systems, in practically all the levels of decision-making and detail. Based on a previous work, this paper complements the analysis of the use of PN for the modeling and simulation of industrial systems. A main stage in the PN modeling methodology is the choice of the appropriate PN formalism, depending on the level of abstraction of the formalism and to the interpretative extensions they are provided with. Special attention is paid to the semantics or interpretation of timed transitions, as well as to the aim of the model. Moreover, even when dealing with DES, the intrinsic nature of the parts of the model (discrete, continuous or hybrid) must be considered. Continuous PNs, was originally devised like an approach to deal with discrete systems efficiently when the well-known problem of state explosion occurs; but they can also be used as a formalism to model continuous concepts of the production systems (as usual with Forrester Diagrams in system dynamics).},

The comparison is complemented taking into account the interpretation of linear ordinary differential equation systems (LODES), the information delays and some methodological considerations. ISSCPNs permit to model any LODES when known upper and lower bounds of the state variables exists. Therefore systems with cyclic behaviour or delays in the information can be modelled. © 2004 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Petri Nets (PNs) is a well-known modelling paradigm for discrete event systems (DES). As in other paradigms, hybrid and continuous PN formalisms have appeared in the literature, some of them being used in different engineering application domains. Hybridization may be obtained for example 'by direct addition' of capabilities to model continuous subsystems. The approach adopted in this work is different: hybrid and continuous models appear because natural variables of a PN-DES model are transformed into non-negative reals. This relaxation may be quite reasonable when very populated or high traffic systems are considered. It is a classical relaxation applied to fight against the state explosion problem appearing when dealing with the analysis and synthesis of models. In tune with this, the paper presents 'a biased' view of works in the hybrid PN arena. Partly an overview, this work revisits hybrid and continuous PNs, all of them being in essence hybrid models. Limitations to (partial) fluidification, and analysis and synthesis problems in this evolving field are considered. Several optimization problems (at design and at control) are also introduced here.},

	abstract = {Petri nets are formalisms for the modeling of discrete event dynamic systems (DEDS). The integrality of the marking and of the transitions firing counters is a clear reflection of this. To reduce the computational complexity of the analysis or synthesis of Petri nets, two relaxations have been introduced at two different levels: (1) at net level, leading to continuous [1]-[3] net systems; (2) at state equation (or fundamental equation) level, which has allowed to obtain systems of linear inequalities, or linear programming problems [4]-[6]. These relaxations are mainly related to the fractional firing of transitions, which implies the existence of non-integer markings. For instance, a first-order continuization transforms a discrete and stochastic model, into a continuous and deterministic 'approximated' model. The purpose of our work is to give an overview of this energing field. It is focused on the relationship between the properties of (discrete) PNs and the corresponding properties of their continuous approximation. Through the interleaving of qualitative and quantitative techniques, surprising results can be obtained from the analysis of these continuous systems. For these approximations to be 'acceptable', it is necessary that large markings (populations) exist. It will also be seen, however, that not every populated net system can be continuized. In fact, there exist systems with 'large' populations for which continuization does not make sense. The possibility of expressing non-linear behaviors may lead to deterministic continuous differential systems with complex behaviors (orbits, limit cycles, different attractors, and chaos).},

In this paper, DSSP are presented, illustrating their usability in manufacturing systems. They are compared to other more restrictive subclasses of Petri nets used for similar purposes. In spite of being more expressive, DSSP still enjoy many strong analytical results, some of which are derived and illustrated in the paper.},

	abstract = {Liveness is a basic property that in many discrete event dynamic systems is considered essential for their correct behavior. It expresses that no action (transition in P/T models) will ever become unattainable. A polynomial time necessary condition for the existence of a live and bounded marking of a P/T net is given. This condition is shown to be also sufficient for some subclasses. The applicability of these results is extended by the use of transformation techniques that allow for their exploitation in the analysis of more general nets. Some results for the structural analysis of actual liveness are also overviewed, in particular, sufficient conditions for deadlock-freeness and absence of dead transitions.},

	abstract = {Fairness properties are very important for the behavior characterization of distributed concurrent systems. This paper discusses in detail a bounded-fairness (or B-fairness) theory applied to Petri Net (PN) models. For a given initial marking two transitions in a Petri Net are said to be in a B-fair relation (BF-relation) if the number of times that either can fire before the other fires is bounded. Two transitions are in a structural B-fair relation (SF-relation) if they are in a B-fair relation for any initial marking. A (structural) B-fair net is a net in which every pair of transitions is in a (structural) B-fair relation. The above B-fairness concepts are further extended to groups (or subsets) of transitions, and are called group B-fairness. This paper presents complete characterizations of these B-fairness concepts. In addition, algorithms are given for determining B-fairness and structural B-fairness relations. It is shown that structural B-fairness relations can be computed in polynomial time. © 1992.},

One of the main industrial requirements was to acheive a high degree of safeness at low cost. The overall architecture of the system is developed to provide reasonable protection against failures. It is centered around a triple schema: 1) Use of off-line testing techniques of the computer support (as a background task); 2) Use of an abstract copy of the application software acting as a generalized watch-dog, the spy; and 3) Use of special error detecting/correcting codes for essential information concerning the state of the system, plus executable assertions concerning the critical procedures. In this paper we introduce the ideas and techniques that define the spy. Because the kind of system to be controlled is highly concurrent, Petri nets were adopted as the formal tool to describe concurrency. Their graphical representation plus their extensive validation theory will help the designer in the phases previous to software implementation. © 1988.},

Petri nets have been used extensively in applications such as automated manufacturing, and there exists a large body of tools for qualitative and quantitative analysis of Petri nets. The goal of Petri net research in discrete event systems is to exploit the structural properties of Petri net models in computationally efficient algorithms for computing controls. We present an overview of the various models and problems formulated in the literature focusing on two particular models, the controlled Petri nets and the labeled nets. We describe two basic approaches for controller synthesis, based on state feedback and event feedback. We also discuss two efficient techniques for the on-line computation of the control law, namely the linear integer programming approach which takes advantage of the linear structure of the Petri net state transition equation, and path-based algorithms which take advantage of the graphical structure of Petri net models. Extensions to timed models are briefly described. The paper concludes with a discussion of directions for future research.},
