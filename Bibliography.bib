	Abstract	= {We motivate and study the subnet reduction of Petri nets. Subnet reduction can avoid the state exploration problem by guaranteeing the correctness in the Petri net. For systems specified in Petri nets, this paper proposes two subnet reduction methods. One major advantage of these reduction methods is that the resultant ordinary Petri net is guaranteed to be live, bounded and reversible. A group of sufficient conditions or sufficient and necessary conditions of liveness preservation, boundedness preservation and reversibility preservation are proposed. A flexible manufacturing system has been verified. These results are useful for studying the static and dynamic properties of Petri nets, analyzing properties for large complex system},

	Abstract	= {This is an invited tutorial-review paper on Petri nets-a graphical and mathematical modeling tool. Petri nets are a promising tool for describing and studying information processing systems that are characterized as being concurrent, asynchronous, distributed, parallel, nondeterministic, and/or stochastic. The paper starts with a brief review of the history and the appli- cation areas considered in the literature. It then proceeds with introductory modeling examples, behavioral and structural prop- erties, three methods of analysis, subclasses of Petri nets and their analysis. In particular, one section is devoted to marked graphs- the concurrent system model most amenable to analysis. In addi- tion, the paper presents introductory discussions on stochastic nets with their application to performance modeling, and on high-level nets with their application to logic programming. Also included are recent results on reachability criteria. Suggestions are provided for further reading on many subject areas of Petri nets},

@article{jimenez,
	Abstract	= {The use of Petri nets as a tool for optimizing logistic systems of industrial supply by simulation is analyzed in this article. The application of these tools presents two basic advantages: (1) their graphic/mathematical interpretation makes them particularly useful to be applied in simulation/analysis (optimization) applications, and (2) they can be considered from a discrete/continuous point of view, as a paradigm for modeling and analyzing discrete systems or as a continuous approximation to the real discrete model. These properties are very interesting in a global simulation analysis of logistic systems because their management is usually limited by their high complexity and large dimension. Petri nets are applied to the modeling and analysis of discrete logistic systems in the classical way, using the relatively recent continuization and fluidification techniques of discrete systems for their continuous approximation. This new methodology provides results with less computational effort.},

We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},
